## Introduction
Genetic variation between tumor cells and normal cells have been extensively investigated. However, genome differences between tissues within individuals are far less understood. It is commonly assumed that all normal tissue that from the same zygote sharing same content but get difference from epigenetics effect. In most of the inhertance and cancer research, use blood tissue to replace the germline cell. In this repository, we developed the snakemake pipeline to compare the genome between blood tissue and testis based on next generate sequencing result. 

## Method
### Workflow
### Step 1 Sequencing QC and trim
### Step 2 Alignment
### Step 3 GATK recalibate and SNP&INDEL filter
### Step 4 Tissue comparison
### Step 6 Visualization
